Read [this](https://create-react-app.dev/) documentation for more details


<h1> :bookmark: Script require to run the project</h1>

<li>For Bootstrap, add Script for Javascript and CSS</li><br>

In the project directory, you have the following scripts to run:

    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"

### `npm start`

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Runs the app in the development mode.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Builds the app for production to `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes build for best performance.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your app is ready to be deployed!

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
